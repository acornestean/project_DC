<p>Both links use the same site permission add-on which was generated via the form from AMO DEV. As such, the below prefs must be created/set in about:config. After setting the prefs, a browser restart will be required.</p>
<ul>
<li> xpinstall.signatures.dev-root = true </li>
<li> dom.webmidi.enabled = true </li>
<li> midi.testing = true </li>
</ul>
<p> The first link proposes to test the distribution control mechanism in which installation will be disallowed for add-ons which, even though have a valid origin, the add-on is hosted somewhere else.</p>
<p> The second link proposes to test the scenario in which the add-on has a valid origin and installation is triggered from the origin domain. As such, installation will be allowed and the permission will be granted to the domain post installation. </p>
